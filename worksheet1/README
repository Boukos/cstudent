Open ``operations.c`` with your favorite editor (``nano operations.c``, or ``vim`` or ``emacs``).

Follow the instructions in the file. You will have to implement four functions: ``addition``, ``subtraction``, ``multiplication``, and ``division``.

The ``main.c`` file contains a list of assertion statements that will pass if your implementation is correct. If you're not quite sure what the four functions *should* do, then you can take a look in here, e.g. with ``cat main.c``.

To compile and run your program, type: ``./test`` OR

Compile your program with ``gcc operations.c`` and run the binary with ``./a.out``. You can also compile your program with ``clang operations.c`` which is just a different C compiler, but it may give you better error messages if you don't know what GCC is telling you.
